Test1:

I observerd sometime instead of saying Living room he would say Hall room / TV room so added synonyms for the room wherever possible.

Sometime he would say clean my room instead of saying his bedroom so, I created asynonym for bedroom.

Test2:

Sometimes My roommate ilike to play with the suction level of the Vacuum. The maximum Suction which I defined is 5. My friend would ask it to set the level to 6. So i included a secondary response if the input goes out of bounds to inform the user.

Did the same thing for Scheduling. If he wants to schedule it for yesterday. Its not possible.

Test 3:

In the final test after overcoming all the above shortcoming. I have noticed a few more.

I was not able to retrive information on future schedules if the user asked.I tries to create a new entity and using the concept of contexts to fetch the information on schedules which are already created but couldn't. I will try it in future asignments if possible.

Similiary I was not able to get the current Suction level info.
